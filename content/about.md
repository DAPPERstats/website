<h3>DAPPER Stats provides on-point quantitative research and support for every stage in the scientific process.</h3>

We work primarily in the biological sciences, and specialize in population biology, conservation, and biometrics. Our clients include academic institutions, non-profit organizations, government agencies, and local municipalities.

DAPPER founder Juniper (they/them) Simonis studied Integrative Biology at the University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign as an undergraduate and obtained their PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Cornell University. Juniper brings over a decade of experience in the fields of quantitative and conservation biology to DAPPER.

DAPPER has a governing philosophy that the final data product should be easy to understand and use, even if whats under the hood is a complex statistical model. We believe in creating products that help our clients answer their pressing questions effectively and efficiently. The reports, apps, code, and other products we generate are like an immaculately pressed shirt: functional and good-looking without being ostentatious.

We thrive when analyzing the viability of adaptively managed populations, estimating take of endangered species, and describing the spatial dynamics of ecological systems, but that’s not all we do. DAPPER Stats is also committed to making STEM fields more inclusive and welcoming to a diversity of people. To that end, we provide educational and training services for institutions interested in making science as diverse as nature.

DAPPER Stats is a certified woman-owned business and a certified emerging small business.
