We are applying cutting-edge computational tools to automate forecasting of ecological populations in realtime. 
In association, we are translating forecasting science from disparate domains to ecological settings in order to best leverage contemporary methods.

Much of this work is done in collaboration with the [Weecology Lab](https://www.weecology.org).
