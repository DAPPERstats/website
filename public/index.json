This type of data, however, may not be suitable for this purpose given high spatiotemporal variability of native bee activity. By comparing phenological metrics calculated from intensive systematic inventory data with those from opportunistic museum records for bee species spanning a range of functional traits, we explored biases and limitations of data types to determine best practices for bee monitoring and assessment. We compiled half a million records of wild bee occurrence from opportunistic museum collections and six systematic inventory efforts, focusing analyses on 45 well-represented species that spanned five functional traits: sociality, nesting habits, floral specialization, voltinism, and body size. We then used permutation tests to evaluate differences between data types in estimating three phenology metrics: flight duration, number of annual abundance peaks, and date of the highest peak. We used GLMs to test for patterns of data type significance across traits. All 45 species differed significantly in the value of at least one phenology metric depending on the data type used. The date of the highest abundance peak differed for 40 species, flight duration for 34 species, and the number of peaks for 15 species. The number of peaks was more likely to differ between data types for larger bees, and flight duration was more likely to differ for larger bees and specialist bees. Our results reveal a strong influence of data type on phenology metrics that necessitates consideration of data source when evaluating changes in phenological activity, possibly applicable to many taxa. Accurately assessing phenological change may require expanding wild bee monitoring and data sharing.","tags":null,"title":"The influence of data type and functional traits on native bee phenology metrics: Opportunistic versus inventory records","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Although ecology is rife with theory that explores how multiple species co-occur through space and time, the field lacks robust statistical models to parameterize this theory with empirical data, particularly when species are detected imperfectly and data are collected as a time-series.\n2. We address this need by developing an occupancy model that estimates local colonization and extinction rates for two or more interacting species when data are collected across multiple sampling occasions. This model estimates how community composition at a site may change across sampling occasions by assuming the latent occupancy state is a categorical random variable. We used a multinomial‐logit model to parameterize species specific parameters and pairwise interactions between species, both of which can be made a function of covariates. These transition probabilities between community states can then be converted to occupancy or co-occurrence probabilities to determine how community composition varies along an environmental gradient or through time.\n3. As an example, we estimate patterns of co-occurrence between coyote *Canis latrans*, Virginia opossum *Didelphis virginiana*, and raccoon *Procyon lotor* in Chicago, Illinois, USA with data from a multiyear camera trapping study. Models with pairwise interactions between species greatly out performed models that assumed independence between species. Opossum and raccoon, for example, were far less likely to go extinct in habitat patches where coyotes were present.\n4. Community composition at a site depends on species interactions and the local environment. Our model can separate such effects by estimating the underlying processes that define species occurrence patterns. As a result, our model can more explicitly quantify a wide range of ecological dynamics and therefore be used to empirically test ecological theory, such as estimating priority effects at a site or turnover rates between species, both of which can be made to vary as a function of covariates.","tags":null,"title":"A multistate dynamic occupancy model to estimate local colonization–extinction rates and patterns of co-occurrence between two or more interacting species","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

To reduce management reliance on an estuary-wide annual population index that minimizes data resolution and ignores uncertainty, our model took a spatiotemporal approach and explicitly accounted for sampling and observation variation through both stochastic and deterministic elements. Our model demonstrated that juvenile smelt density has decreased over annual time and displays a distinct seasonal pattern (the combination of growth into the sampled size class, mortality, and movement into and out of the sampling frame) of increases in March–June followed by decreases in June–August. Smelt density was highly spatiotemporally autocorrelated and strongly tracked prey availability yet was also constrained by local hydrological factors (salinity, turbidity, velocity). Specifically, juvenile smelt preferred slightly saline, turbid, generally slow‐moving water with ample copepod prey. However, poor swimming capabilities reduced the capacity of juvenile smelt to mix throughout the estuary and find optimal habitat, emphasizing the importance of accounting for spatiotemporal autocorrelation in species distribution models. Further, whole‐estuary outflow appeared to influence the spatial distribution of covariates and juvenile smelt, such that smelt densities tended to peak closer to the marine zone at a lower maximal value when outflow was high. The predictions of our model accurately matched observed patterns of juvenile delta smelt catch while embracing uncertainty (although the predictions tended to exaggerate the total smelt catch variation via over‐predicted tail values). These results highlight that data‐driven improvements can be made to the analytical methods currently used to guide delta smelt management and lay the groundwork for mitigating the impacts of water use, flow regimes, habitat alteration, and climate change on an endangered species in a highly impacted and economically consequential habitat.","tags":null,"title":"Prey availability, environmental constraints, and aggregation dictate distribution of an imperiled fish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

SSPs issue animal-specific recommendations to participating institutions via Breeding and Transfer Plans (BTPs). Fulfillment of recommendations is a crucial step in maintaining viable populations, but there have been no comprehensive evaluations of the system. Using PMCTrack, a database of over 110,000 breeding and transfer recommendations issued from over 200 SSPs from 1999 to 2013, we analyzed fulfillment of recommendations. Action-based recommendations had lower rates: Breed With recommendations were fulfilled at a rate of 20.0% before the next BTP, Send To at 56.8%, Do Not Breed at 95.7%, and Hold at 92.9%. We used generalized (logistic) mixed-effects model regressions to evaluate the impact of biological, management, and programmatic factors on fulfillment rates. For all recommendation types, there was significant variation in fulfillment among Programs and within Programs among BTPs. Out of 80 potential hypothesized fixed effects (20 factors * 4 recommendation types), only 20 effects (25%) were statistically significant. Rates were strongly influenced by temporal variables, generally increasing over time and as programs get older. Notably, the amount of time between BTPs was the only variable that significantly predicted fulfillment of all recommendation types. Many additional factors at the individual animal and institutional level may effect fulfillment rates and should be the subject of future analysis. Our results illustrate the utility of PMCTrack and indicate that improvements to the viability of SSPs will need to address multiple biological and management challenges.","tags":null,"title":"Uncovering challenges to sustainability of AZA Animal Programs by evaluating the outcomes of breeding and transfer recommendations with PMCTrack","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Its development was motivated by the need to accurately estimate the total number of bird and bat fatalities occurring at wind and solar energy facilities, but it is applicable in a variety of other contexts as well. Simple counts of carcasses are not an accurate measure of the true number of fatalities because some carcasses are inevitably missed in carcass searches. Furthermore, simple carcass counts do not allow comparison among locations or years because carcasses may be detected at different rates. This software uses data collected during carcass searches and estimates of detection rates to accurately estimate the number of fatalities and to provide a measure of precision associated with the estimate. These estimates are fundamental to understanding acute and cumulative effects of renewable energy development on wildlife populations. The software package is available with a user-friendly graphic interface as well as a flexible and powerful command-line implementation. GenEst includes tools for estimating searcher efficiency, carcass persistence, and other detection probability parameters from experimental field trials. Included in the software are example datasets for analyses, standard R package help files, this user guide, and vignettes detailing use at the command-line.","tags":null,"title":"GenEst User Guide—Software for a Generalized Estimator of Mortaltiy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

We evaluated the effect of movement on the genetic and demographic viability of the red wolf (*Canis rufus*) and tested the application of metapopulation theory to management of this endangered predator. The establishment of a captive subpopulation in the 1970s allowed persistence of the species and facilitated a reintroduction program that supported 2 wild subpopulations, one of which persists today. We assessed the effect of historical and potential future movement between the wild and captive subpopulations on the genetic and demographic viability of the metapopulation. We analyzed approximately 30 years of individual-level data to quantify the effects of historical movement among subpopulations and constructed an individual-based metapopulation model to predict the effects of future potential movement (i.e., releases of captive wolves) on the species’ persistence and genetic diversity. Counter to theory, increased movement has had positive demographic effects, with higher per capita movement rates leading to increased metapopulation growth and decreased subpopulation synchrony. These counter-theoretical results are likely due to differences in reproduction and survival rates among subpopulations and the small size of the metapopulation. Furthermore, higher rates of movement did not increase retention of genetic diversity, likely because of the active pedigree-based breeding management of the species already maximizing gene retention. Our model indicates that future releases of captive wolves are necessary, but not sufficient, for the survival of the species, and must be combined with changes to demographic rates in both the captive and northeastern North Carolina subpopulations. Our results highlight the need for models and field data that more adequately describe the viability of small metapopulations.","tags":null,"title":"Movement and mixing in a managed metapopulation of the critically endangered red wolf","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.
